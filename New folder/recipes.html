	<p>I adapted this recipe from a book called <cite cite="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/0864119917/">Sydney Food</cite> by Bill Graiger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in kings Cross, Sydney, i have since transformed it into what I really believe are the <em>best</em> scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>

	<p>This recipe is what I call a <q>Very special breakfast</q>; just look at the ingredient to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>

	  <ul>
	  	<li>2 eggs</li>
	  	<li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>
	  	<li>1/3 cup of cream <i> (2 3/4 ounces)</i></li>
	  	<li>A pinch of salt</li>
	  	<li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
	  	<li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>
	  </ul>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>

	  <ol>
	  	<li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>
	  	<li>Melt the butter in a non-stck pan over a high heat <i>(taking care not to burn the butter)</i></li>
	  	<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it start setting around the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>
	  	<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
	  	<li>Fold contents in again, leave fo 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
	  	<li>grind a light sprinking og freshly milled pepper and eggs and blend in some chooped fresh chives. </li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>You should only make a <strong>maximum</strong> of two serving per frying pan.</p>
